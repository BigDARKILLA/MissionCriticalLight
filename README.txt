README

Description:
This was a simple project in which I was allowed 3 hours to create a mission critical system in Python. The requirements for the project included creating a GUI and handling any errors that would cause the program to crash. 
This was my first experience with the Tkinter module in Python. Because of this and the time constraints, I focused on implementing a working system rather than worry about organization or extensibility. As a result, the code is a bit messy.

Additional Notes:
This is a Python 2 application.
